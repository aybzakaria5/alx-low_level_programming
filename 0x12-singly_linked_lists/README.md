#**SINGLY LINKED LISTS**
This directory contains  code that implements singly linked lists in **C**.

A **singly linked** list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes from the list, as well as traversal of the list in a forward direction.

The main **advantage** of a _linked list_ over an _array_ is that it allows for _dynamic memory allocation_, which means that the size of the list can be changed during runtime. This is not possible with an array, which has a fixed size.

Linked lists, however, have a _higher_ overhead compared to arrays in terms of memory usage and time complexity. This is because each node in the list requires a separate memory allocation, and traversing the list requires following the pointers from one node to the next.
