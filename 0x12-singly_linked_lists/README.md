This directory contains  code that implements singly linked lists in **C**.

A **singly linked** list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes from the list, as well as traversal of the list in a forward direction.

The main advantage of a linked list over an array is that it allows for dynamic memory allocation, which means that the size of the list can be changed during runtime. This is not possible with an array, which has a fixed size.

Linked lists, however, have a higher overhead compared to arrays in terms of memory usage and time complexity. This is because each node in the list requires a separate memory allocation, and traversing the list requires following the pointers from one node to the next.
